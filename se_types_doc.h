    3 = Cumulative

    The sum of the previous billing period values. Note: “Cumulative” is commonly used in conjunction with “demand.” Each demand reset causes the maximum demand value for the present billing period (since the last demand reset) to accumulate as an accumulative total of all maximum demands. So instead of “zeroing” the demand register, a demand reset has the affect of adding the present maximum demand to this accumulating total.

    4 = DeltaData

    The difference between the value at the end of the prescribed interval and the beginning of the interval. This is used for incremental interval data. 

    Note: One common application would be for load profile data, another use might be to report the number of events within an interval (such as the number of equipment energizations within the specified period of time.)

    6 = Indicating

    As if a needle is swung out on the meter face to a value to indicate the current value. (Note: An “indicating” value is typically measured over hundreds of milliseconds or greater, or may imply a “pusher” mechanism to capture a value. Compare this to “instantaneous” which is measured over a shorter period of time.) 

    9 = Summation

    A form of accumulation which is selective with respect to time. 

    Note : “Summation” could be considered a specialization of “Bulk Quantity” according to the rules of inheritance where “Summation” selectively accumulates pulses over a timing pattern, and “BulkQuantity” accumulates pulses all of the time.

    12 = Instantaneous

    Typically measured over the fastest period of time allowed by the definition of the metric (usually milliseconds or tens of milliseconds.) (Note: “Instantaneous” was moved to attribute #3 in 61968-9Ed2 from attribute #1 in 61968-9Ed1.)

    @var SE_ReadingType_t::calorificValue
    The amount of heat generated when a given mass of fuel is completely burned. The CalorificValue is used to convert the measured volume or mass of gas into kWh. The CalorificValue attribute represents the current active value.

    @var SE_ReadingType_t::commodity
    Indicates the commodity applicable to this ReadingType.

    @var SE_ReadingType_t::conversionFactor
    Accounts for changes in the volume of gas based on temperature and pressure. The ConversionFactor attribute represents the current active value. The ConversionFactor is dimensionless. The default value for the ConversionFactor is 1, which means no conversion is applied. A price server can advertise a new/different value at any time.

    @var SE_ReadingType_t::dataQualifier
    The data type can be used to describe a salient attribute of the data. Possible values are average, absolute, and etc.

    Anything involving current might have a flow direction. Possible values include forward and reverse.

    @var SE_ReadingType_t::intervalLength
    Default interval length specified in seconds.

    @var SE_ReadingType_t::kind
    Compound class that contains kindCategory and kindIndex

    @var SE_ReadingType_t::maxNumberOfIntervals
    To be populated for mirrors of interval data to set the expected number of intervals per ReadingSet. Servers may discard intervals received that exceed this number.

    @var SE_ReadingType_t::numberOfConsumptionBlocks
    Number of consumption blocks. 0 means not applicable, and is the default if not specified. The value needs to be at least 1 if any actual prices are provided.

    @var SE_ReadingType_t::numberOfTouTiers
    The number of TOU tiers that can be used by any resource configured by this ReadingType. Servers SHALL populate this value with the largest touTier value that will <i>ever</i> be used while this ReadingType is in effect. Servers SHALL set numberOfTouTiers equal to the number of standard TOU tiers plus the number of CPP tiers that may be used while this ReadingType is in effect. Servers SHALL specify a value between 0 and 255 (inclusive) for numberOfTouTiers (servers providing flat rate pricing SHOULD set numberOfTouTiers to 0, as in practice there is no difference between having no tiers and having one tier).

    @var SE_ReadingType_t::phase
    Contains phase information associated with the type.

    @var SE_ReadingType_t::powerOfTenMultiplier
    Indicates the power of ten multiplier applicable to the unit of measure of this ReadingType.

    @var SE_ReadingType_t::subIntervalLength
    Default sub-interval length specified in seconds for Readings of ReadingType. Some demand calculations are done over a number of smaller intervals. For example, in a rolling demand calculation, the demand value is defined as the rolling sum of smaller intervals over the intervalLength. The subintervalLength is the length of the smaller interval in this calculation. It SHALL be an integral division of the intervalLength. The number of sub-intervals can be calculated by dividing the intervalLength by the subintervalLength.

    @var SE_ReadingType_t::supplyLimit
    Reflects the supply limit set in the meter. This value can be compared to the Reading value to understand if limits are being approached or exceeded. Units follow the same definition as in this ReadingType.

    @var SE_DERControlBase_t::opModFixedPF
    The opModFixedPF function specifies a requested fixed Power Factor (PF) setting, consisting of a signed displacement value. The PF sign (which SHALL be interpreted according to the EEI convention, where unity PF is considered unsigned) indicates the direction of reactive power flow. The actual displacement SHALL be within the limits established by setMinPF and setMinPFNeg. If issued simultaneously with other reactive power controls (e.g. opModFixedVar) the control resulting in least var magnitude SHOULD take precedence.

    @var SE_DERControlBase_t::opModFixedVar
    The opModFixedVar function specifies the delivered or received reactive power setpoint.  The context for the setpoint value is determined by refType and SHALL be one of %setMaxW, %setMaxVar, or %statVarAvail.

    @var SE_DERControlBase_t::opModHVRTMomentaryCessation
    Specify curve type == 6.  The High Voltage Ride-Through (HVRT) function is specified by duration-volt curves that define the operating region under high voltage conditions.  Each HVRT curve is specified by an array of duration-volt pairs that will be interpolated into a piecewise linear function that defines an operating region.  The x value of each pair specifies a duration (time at a given voltage in seconds).

Each LFRT curve is specified by an array of duration-frequency pairs that will be interpolated into a piecewise linear function that defines an operating region.  The x value of each pair specifies a duration (time at a given frequency in seconds). The y value of each pair specifies a frequency, in Hz. This control specifies the "must trip" region.

    @var SE_DERControlBase_t::opModLVRTMomentaryCessation
    Specify curve type == 4.  The Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) function is specified by duration-volt curves that define the operating region under low voltage conditions.  Each LVRT curve is specified by an array of duration-volt pairs that will be interpolated into a piecewise linear function that defines an operating region.  The x value of each pair specifies a duration (time at a given voltage in seconds). The y value of each pair specifies an effective percent voltage, defined as ((locally measured voltage - setVRefOfs) / setVRef). This control specifies the "momentary cessation" region.

The y value of each pair specifies an effective percent voltage, defined as ((locally measured voltage - setVRefOfs) / setVRef). This control specifies the "must trip" region.

    @var SE_DERControlBase_t::opModMaxLimW
    The opModMaxLimW function sets the maximum active power generation level at the electrical coupling point as a percentage of set capacity (%setMaxW, in hundredths). This limitation may be met e.g. by reducing PV output or by using excess PV output to charge associated storage.

    @var SE_DERControlBase_t::opModTargetVar
    Target reactive power, in var. This control is likely to be more useful for aggregators, as individual DERs may not be able to maintain a target setting.

    @var SE_DERControlBase_t::opModTargetW
    Target output power, in Watts. This control is likely to be more useful for aggregators, as individual DERs may not be able to maintain a target setting.

    @var SE_DERControlBase_t::opModVoltVar
    Specify DERCurveLink for curve type == 0.  The static volt-var function provides over- or under-excited var compensation as a function of measured voltage. The volt-var curve is specified as an array of volt-var pairs that are interpolated into a piecewise linear function with hysteresis. The x value of each pair specifies an effective percent voltage, defined as ((locally measured voltage - setVRefOfs) / setVRef) and SHOULD support a domain of at least 0 - 135.  The y value specifies a target var output interpreted as a signed percentage (-100 to 100). The meaning of the y value is determined by yRefType and must be one of %setMaxW, %setMaxVar, or %statVarAvail.

    @var SE_DERControlBase_t::opModVoltWatt
    Specify DERCurveLink for curve type == 3.  The Volt-Watt reduces active power output as a function of measured voltage. The Volt-Watt curve is specified as an array of Volt-Watt pairs that are interpolated into a piecewise linear function with hysteresis. The x value of each pair specifies an effective percent voltage, defined as ((locally measured voltage - setVRefOfs) / setVRef) and SHOULD support a domain of at least 0 - 135. The y value specifies an active power output in %setMaxW, (0 - 100).

    @var SE_DERControlBase_t::opModWattPF
    Specify DERCurveLink for curve type == 2.  The Watt-PF function varies Power Factor (PF) as a function of delivered active power. The Watt-PF curve is specified as an array of Watt-PF coordinates that are interpolated into a piecewise linear function with hysteresis.  The x value of each pair specifies a watt setting in %setMaxW, (0 - 100). The PF output setting is a signed displacement in y value (PF sign SHALL be interpreted according to the EEI convention, where unity PF is considered unsigned). These settings are not expected to be updated very often during the life of the installation, therefore only a single curve is required.  If issued simultaneously with other reactive power controls (e.g. opModFixedPF) the control resulting in least var magnitude SHOULD take precedence.

    @var SE_DERControlBase_t::opModWattVar
    Specify DERCurveLink for curve type == 10. The Watt-Var function varies vars as a function of delivered active power. The Watt-Var curve is specified as an array of Watt-Var pairs that are interpolated into a piecewise linear function with hysteresis. The x value of each pair specifies a watt setting in %setMaxW, (0-100). The y value specifies a target var output interpreted as a signed percentage (-100 to 100). The meaning of the y value is determined by yRefType and must be one of %setMaxW, %setMaxVar, or %statVarAvail.

    @var SE_DERControlBase_t::rampTms
    Requested ramp time, in hundredths of a second, for the device to transition from the current DERControl  mode setting(s) to the new mode setting(s). If absent, use default ramp rate (setGradW).  Resolution is 1/100 sec.

    Field representing the current status type. 

    0 = Scheduled

    This status indicates that the event has been scheduled and the event has not yet started.  The server SHALL set the event to this status when the event is first scheduled and persist until the event has become active or has been cancelled.  For events with a start time less than or equal to the current time, this status SHALL never be indicated, the event SHALL start with a status of “Active”. 

    1 = Active

    This status indicates that the event is currently active. The server SHALL set the event to this status when the event reaches its earliest Effective Start Time.

    2 = Cancelled 

    When events are cancelled, the Status.dateTime attribute SHALL be set to the time the cancellation occurred, which cannot be in the future.  The server is responsible for maintaining the cancelled event in its collection for the duration of the original event, or until the server has run out of space and needs to store a new event. Client devices SHALL be aware of Cancelled events, determine if the Cancelled event applies to them, and cancel the event immediately if applicable.

    3 = Cancelled with Randomization 

    The server is responsible for maintaining the cancelled event in its collection for the duration of the Effective Scheduled Period. Client devices SHALL be aware of Cancelled with Randomization events, determine if the Cancelled event applies to them, and cancel the event immediately, using the larger of (absolute value of randomizeStart) and (absolute value of randomizeDuration) as the end randomization, in seconds. This Status.type SHALL NOT be used with "regular" Events, only with specializations of RandomizableEvent.

    4 = Superseded

    Events marked as Superseded by servers are events that may have been replaced by new events from the same program that target the exact same set of deviceCategory's (if applicable) and overlap for a given period of time. Servers SHALL mark an event as Superseded at the earliest Effective Start Time of the overlapping event. Servers are responsible for maintaining the Superseded event in their collection for the duration of the Effective Scheduled Period. 

    Client devices encountering a Superseded event SHALL terminate execution of the event immediately and commence execution of the new event immediately, unless the current time is within the start randomization window of the superseded event, in which case the client SHALL obey the start randomization of the new event. This Status.type SHALL NOT be used with TextMessage, since multiple text messages can be active.

    In combination with flowRateStartLimit, allows a service provider to define the demand or output characteristics for the particular tariff design.  If a server includes the flowRateEndLimit attribute, then it SHALL also include flowRateStartLimit attribute.

    For example, a service provider’s tariff limits customers to 20 kWs of demand for the given rate structure.  Above this threshold (from 20-50 kWs), there are different demand charges per unit of consumption.  The service provider can use flowRateStartLimit and flowRateEndLimit to describe the demand characteristics of the different rates.  Similarly, these attributes can be used to describe limits on premises DERs that might be producing a commodity and sending it back into the distribution network. 

    Note: At the time of writing, service provider tariffs with demand-based components were not originally identified as being in scope, and service provider tariffs vary widely in their use of demand components and the method for computing charges.  It is expected that industry groups (e.g., OpenSG) will document requirements in the future that the IEEE 2030.5 community can then use as source material for the next version of IEEE 2030.5.

/** @struct SE_EnvironmentalCost_t se_types.h

    Implementers and consumers can use this attribute to prioritize operations of their HAN devices (e.g., PEV charging during times of high availability of renewable electricity resources).

    @var SE_EnvironmentalCost_t::amount
    The estimated or actual environmental or other cost, per commodity unit defined by the ReadingType, for this RateComponent (e.g., grams of carbon dioxide emissions each per kWh).

    @var SE_EnvironmentalCost_t::costKind
    The kind of cost referred to in the amount.

    @var SE_EnvironmentalCost_t::costLevel
    The relative level of the amount attribute.  In conjunction with numCostLevels, this attribute informs a device of the relative scarcity of the amount attribute (e.g., a high or low availability of renewable generation).

    numCostLevels and costLevel values SHALL ascend in order of scarcity, where "0" signals the lowest relative cost and higher values signal increasing cost.  For example, if numCostLevels is equal to “3,” then if the lowest relative costLevel were equal to “0,” devices would assume this is the lowest relative period to operate.  Likewise, if the costLevel in the next TimeTariffInterval instance is equal to “1,” then the device would assume it is relatively more expensive, in environmental terms, to operate during this TimeTariffInterval instance than the previous one.

    There is no limit to the number of relative price levels other than that indicated in the attribute type, but for practicality, service providers should strive for simplicity and recognize the diminishing returns derived from increasing the numCostLevel value greater than four.

    @var SE_EnvironmentalCost_t::numCostLevels
    The number of all relative cost levels. 

    In conjunction with costLevel, numCostLevels signals the relative scarcity of the commodity for the duration of the TimeTariffInterval instance (e.g., a relative indication of cost). This is useful in providing context for nominal cost signals to consumers or devices that might see a range of amount values from different service providres or from the same service provider.

/** @struct SE_PEVInfo_t se_types.h

    Contains attributes that can be exposed by PEVs and other devices that have charging requirements.

    @var SE_PEVInfo_t::chargingPowerNow
    This is the actual power flow in or out of the charger or inverter. This is calculated by the vehicle based on actual measurements. This number is positive for charging.

    @var SE_PEVInfo_t::energyRequestNow
    This is the amount of energy that must be transferred from the grid to EVSE and PEV to achieve the target state of charge allowing for charger efficiency and any vehicle and EVSE parasitic loads. This is calculated by the vehicle and changes throughout the connection as forward or reverse power flow change the battery state of charge.  This number is positive for charging.

    @var SE_PEVInfo_t::maxForwardPower
    This is maximum power transfer capability that could be used for charging the PEV to perform the requested energy transfer.  It is the lower of the vehicle or EVSE physical power limitations. It is not based on economic considerations. The vehicle may draw less power than this value based on its charging cycle. The vehicle defines this parameter. This number is positive for charging power flow.

    @var SE_PEVInfo_t::minimumChargingDuration
    This is computed by the PEV based on the charging profile to complete the energy transfer if the maximum power is authorized.  The value will never be smaller than the ratio of the energy request to the power request because the charging profile may not allow the maximum power to be used throughout the transfer.   This is a critical parameter for determining whether any slack time exists in the charging cycle between the current time and the TCIN.

    @var SE_PEVInfo_t::targetStateOfCharge
    This is the target state of charge that is to be achieved during charging before the time of departure (TCIN).  The default value is 100%. The value cannot be set to a value less than the actual state of charge.

    @var SE_PEVInfo_t::timeChargeIsNeeded
    Time Charge is Needed (TCIN) is the time that the PEV is expected to depart. The value is manually entered using controls and displays in the vehicle or on the EVSE or using a mobile device.  It is authenticated and saved by the PEV.  This value may be updated during a charging session.

    @var SE_PEVInfo_t::timeChargingStatusPEV
    This is the time that the parameters are updated, except for changes to TCIN.

    @var SE_Subscription_t::limit
    This element is used to indicate the maximum number of list items that should be included in a notification when the subscribed resource changes. This limit is meant to be functionally equivalent to the ‘limit’ query string parameter, but applies to both list resources as well as other resources.  For list resources, if a limit of ‘0’ is specified, then notifications SHALL contain a list resource with results=’0’ (equivalent to a simple change notification).  For list resources, if a limit greater than ‘0’ is specified, then notifications SHALL contain a list resource with results equal to the limit specified (or less, should the list contain fewer items than the limit specified or should the server be unable to provide the requested number of items for any reason) and follow the same rules for list resources (e.g., ordering).  For non-list resources, if a limit of ‘0’ is specified, then notifications SHALL NOT contain a resource representation (equivalent to a simple change notification).  For non-list resources, if a limit greater than ‘0’ is specified, then notifications SHALL contain the representation of the changed resource.

    @var SE_Subscription_t::notificationURI
    The resource to which to post the notifications about the requested subscribed resource. Because this URI will exist on a server other than the one being POSTed to, this attribute SHALL be a fully-qualified absolute URI, not a relative reference.
